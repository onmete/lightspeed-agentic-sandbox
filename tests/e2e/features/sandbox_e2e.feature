# CI trigger verification: behavior-neutral change for sandbox E2E pipelines.
Feature: Sandbox E2E contract
  Verifies: .ai/spec/what/run-api.md (context), .ai/spec/what/audit-logging.md (OTLP traces and audit logs)
  Harness: .ai/spec/what/e2e-testing.md
  Live batch Job tests on a cluster (see scripts/e2e-containers.sh). Exact context prefix
  formatting: test_run_agent.py. Run error rules 22–23: structured_output.feature.

  Scenario: Target namespaces from context reach the model
    Given the sandbox service is running
    And a context with target namespaces and an echo output schema have been prepared
    When I run the agent with the prepared context and schema
    Then the run completes successfully
    And success is true
    And the response namespaces field matches the prepared context

  Scenario: Previous attempts from context reach the model
    Given the sandbox service is running
    And a context with previous attempts and an echo output schema have been prepared
    When I run the agent with the prepared context and schema
    Then the run completes successfully
    And success is true
    And the response first failure reason matches the prepared context

  Scenario: Batch run exports traces and audit logs to OTEL
    Given provider credentials are configured
    And the sandbox service is running
    And the OTEL collector is available for telemetry verification
    And a simple non-skill query has been prepared
    When I run the agent with the prepared query and no output schema
    Then the run completes successfully
    And the OTEL collector received traces for the batch run
    And the OTEL collector received audit logs with agenticrun attributes

  Scenario: Approved option from context reaches the model
    Given the sandbox service is running
    And a context with approved option and an echo output schema have been prepared
    When I run the agent with the prepared context and schema
    Then the run completes successfully
    And success is true
    And the response approved option fields match the prepared context
